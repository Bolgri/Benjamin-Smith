<h1>Hi, I'm Benjamin!

<h2> About Me </h2>
  
  <b>Currently, I'm dedicated to obtaining the Google Cybersecurity Certificate, where I'm immersing myself in a range of technical competencies, including network security, incident response, and vulnerability assessment. This pursuit stems from a diverse career journey that includes roles as an engagement specialist at Alta Resources, a sales consultant at Angi, and an executive chef at both Health House and Gilroy's Pub and Patio. From these experiences, I've cultivated a versatile skill set that I'm eager to bring to a help desk professional role.
Effective communication has been a cornerstone of my career, whether it's articulating complex concepts to clients or collaborating with cross-functional teams. Additionally, my problem-solving abilities were honed in high-pressure environments, where quick thinking and resourcefulness were essential for success. Lastly, my attention to detail and commitment to quality were integral to maintaining high standards of excellence in service delivery.
As I transition into the realm of cybersecurity, I'm excited about the opportunity to apply these skills to provide top-notch support and technical assistance to end-users. With my passion for learning and dedication to mastering cybersecurity principles, I'm confident in my ability to make a meaningful contribution to your team from day one."
